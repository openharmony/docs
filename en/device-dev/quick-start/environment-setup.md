Use the DevEco Device Tool for development, build, burning, and debugging of OpenHarmony.

The DevEco Device Tool is currently available on Windows and Ubuntu. This document takes the Windows version as an example.

For details about how to use the Ubuntu version, see the  [HUAWEI DevEco Device Tool User Guide](https://device.harmonyos.com/en/docs/ide/user-guides/service_introduction-0000001050166905).

The Windows version supports build for the Hi3861 development board only. For other development boards, you should use the Ubuntu version and switch to the Ubuntu platform. The following describes how to set up the development environment and build environment for mini and small OpenHarmony.
