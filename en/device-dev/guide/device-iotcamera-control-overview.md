# Camera Control Overview<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000001055366100"></a>

This document describes how to use the IoT camera development board and the built-in camera of the development kit to implement photographing and video recording.

You can perform operations provided in [Use Case](device-iotcamera-control-example.md)  to learn more about development board peripheral control and then develop devices such as cameras.

If you want to view the sample effect first, see [Use Case](device-iotcamera-control-example.md). To customize application behavior, modify the sample code by referring to APIs described in the next section.

For details about basic concepts for camera development, see [Camera Overview](../subsystems/subsys-multimedia-camera-overview.md).
