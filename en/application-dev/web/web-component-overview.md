# Introduction to ArkWeb


In addition to displaying web page content on applications, ArkWeb provides you with some other helpful functions, including:


- **Page loading**: provides a full set of basic frontend page loading capabilities, which allow you to load network pages, local pages, and HTML text data.

- **Page interaction**: supports a wide range of page interaction modes, which allow you to set the dark mode for frontend pages, load pages in a new window, manage location permissions and cookies, and use frontend page JavaScript code on the application.

- **Page debugging**: uses [DevTools](web-debugging-with-devtools.md) to debug frontend pages.


To help you better understand the features of the **Web** component, the following will exemplify use of the **Web** component in common application scenarios.
