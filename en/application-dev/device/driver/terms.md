# Terms

## A

### AMS

  The Ability Manager Service (AMS) is a system service used to coordinate the running relationships of abilities and schedule the lifecycle of abilities. You can use it to start and disable **DriverExtensionAbility** during driver development.

## B

### BMS

  The Bundle Manager Service (BMS) is responsible for application installation, uninstallation, and data management on OpenHarmony.

## C

### CDB

  A command descriptor block (CDB) is a standard data structure used to send commands in the SCSI protocol. A CDB is a byte array with a fixed length. It contains the operation code (Opcode) and related parameters of the SCSI command and is used to instruct the device to perform operations (such as read, write, and query).

## D

### DDK

  The Driver Development Kit (DDK) is a tool package provided by OpenHarmony for developing drivers for non-standard USB serial port devices based on the peripheral framework.

## H

### HID device

  HID is short for Human Interface Device. An HID device is used for interaction between a person and a computer or another electronic device, and is mainly used for input and output operations.

### HID protocol

  The HID protocol is a standard communication protocol specially designed for human-machine interaction devices. It implements efficient communication between devices and hosts through report descriptors and data reports. It boasts features like plug-and-play, low latency, low bandwidth, and high compatibility, and is widely used in various input and control devices.

## L

### Logical Block

  A logical block is a basic data storage unit. It represents a data area of a fixed size on a device and is usually used for data read and write operations. The size of a logical block may be 512 bytes, 1024 bytes, 2048 bytes, and so on. A specific size depends on a configuration of the device and a design of the file system.

## S

### SCSI

  SCSI is a standard protocol set used for communication between computers and peripherals such as hard disk drives, tape drives, optical disk drives, and scanners.

## U

### USB serial port

  USB-to-Serial is an interface conversion technology that allows data communication with traditional serial ports (such as RS-232 and RS-485) over USB interfaces. This technology is usually implemented by using a dedicated hardware adapter or a specific built-in chip.

## Non-standard peripherals

  Non-standard peripherals (also called custom peripherals or dedicated peripherals) are peripherals that do not comply with general standards or are customized for specific application scenarios. This type of device usually requires special software support or special interfaces to implement communication with the host system.

## Standard peripherals

  Standard peripherals refer to peripherals (such as USB keyboards and mouse devices) that comply with industry standards and specifications. Such devices typically have uniform interface protocols, physical dimensions, and electrical characteristics, so that they can be used interchangeably between different systems.
