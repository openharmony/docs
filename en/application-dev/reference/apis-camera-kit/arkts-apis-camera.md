The module provides a set of easy-to-use camera service APIs. With these APIs, you can create camera applications that access and control camera hardware to achieve basic functions like previewing, taking photos, and recording videos. In addition, you can combine these APIs to perform advanced operations, such as controlling the flash, exposure time, and focus.
