## Overview

The struct describes a rectangle. The coordinate system for the returned detection points is based on the landscape device orientation, with the charging port on the right. In this coordinate system, the top-left corner is (0, 0), and the bottom-right corner is (1, 1). Here, **topLeftX** and **topLeftY** represent the coordinates of the top-left corner of the rectangle, whereas **width** and **height** represent the width and height of the rectangle, respectively. When cropping or selecting a face region based on specific requirements, the x and y coordinates of the rectangle must be multiplied by the width and height of the actual camera output stream to obtain the cropped face region.
