# UIExtensionContext

**UIExtensionContext**, inherited from [ExtensionContext](js-apis-inner-application-extensionContext.md), provides the context environment for [UIExtensionAbility](js-apis-app-ability-uiExtensionAbility.md). It provides UIExtensionAbility-related configuration and APIs for operating the UIExtensionAbility. For example, you can use the APIs to start a UIExtensionAbility.

> **NOTE**
>
>  - The initial APIs of this module are supported since API version 10. Newly added APIs will be marked with a superscript to indicate their earliest API version.
>  - The APIs of this module can be used only in the stage model.

## Modules to Import

```ts
import common from '@ohos.app.ability.common';
```

## UIExtensionContext.startAbility

startAbility(want: Want, callback: AsyncCallback&lt;void&gt;): void;

Starts an ability. This API uses an asynchronous callback to return the result.

Observe the following when using this API:
 - If an application running in the background needs to call this API to start an ability, it must have the **ohos.permission.START_ABILITIES_FROM_BACKGROUND** permission.
 - If **exported** of the target ability is **false** in cross-application scenarios, the caller must have the **ohos.permission.START_INVISIBLE_ABILITY** permission.
 - For details about the startup rules for the components in the stage model, see [Component Startup Rules (Stage Model)](../../application-models/component-startup-rules.md).

**System capability**: SystemCapability.Ability.AbilityRuntime.Core

## UIExtensionContext.startAbilityForResult

startAbilityForResult(want: Want, callback: AsyncCallback&lt;AbilityResult&gt;): void;

Starts an ability. This API uses an asynchronous callback to return the result when the ability is terminated. The following situations may be possible for a started ability:
 - Normally, you can call [terminateSelfWithResult](js-apis-inner-application-uiAbilityContext.md#uiabilitycontextterminateselfwithresult) to terminate the ability. The result is returned to the caller.
 - If an exception occurs, for example, the ability is killed, an error message, in which **resultCode** is **-1**, is returned to the caller.
 - If different applications call this API to start an ability that uses the singleton mode and then call [terminateSelfWithResult](js-apis-inner-application-uiAbilityContext.md#uiabilitycontextterminateselfwithresult) to terminate the ability, the normal result is returned to the last caller, and an exception message, in which **resultCode** is **-1**, is returned to others.

Observe the following when using this API:
 - If an application running in the background needs to call this API to start an ability, it must have the **ohos.permission.START_ABILITIES_FROM_BACKGROUND** permission.
 - If **exported** of the target ability is **false** in cross-application scenarios, the caller must have the **ohos.permission.START_INVISIBLE_ABILITY** permission.
