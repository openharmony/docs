If an app publishes notifications with the same **appMessageId** locally or on the cloud, the device displays only one message. Repeated notifications received later will be silenced and deduplicated, and will not be displayed or notified. The deduplication flag is valid only within 24 hours after the notification is published. After 24 hours or the device is restarted, the deduplication flag becomes invalid. |

This file must be stored in the **resources/rawfile** directory and supports formats such as M4A, AAC, MP3, OGG, WAV, FLAC, and AMR. <!--RP1-->This field takes effect only after the system application with the [ohos.permission.NOTIFICATION_AGENT_CONTROLLER](../../security/AccessToken/permissions-for-system-apps.md#ohospermissionnotification_agent_controller) permission calls the [notificationManager.setAdditionalConfig](./js-apis-notificationManager-sys.md#notificationmanagersetadditionalconfig12) API to set additional configuration.<!--RP1End--> |
