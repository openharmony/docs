# Overview of Application Event Logging

HiAppEvent provides event logging APIs for applications to log the fault, statistical, security, and user behavior events reported during running. Based on event information, you will be able to analyze the running status of your application.

## Basic Concepts

The HiAppEvent module of OpenHarmony can be used to develop application event services and provide functions related to application events, including flushing application events to a disk and querying historical application event data.

**Logging**: Logs changes caused by user operations to provide service data for development, product, and O&M analysis.
