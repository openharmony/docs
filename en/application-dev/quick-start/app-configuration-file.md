## icon

[Application icon](../application-models/application-component-configuration-stage.md) and the index to the layered icon configuration files.

The configuration of layered icons is as follows:

1. Place the foreground and background resources of the icon in the **AppScope/resources/base/media** directory, or use the default foreground and background resources in the directory.

2. The **media** directory contains the **layered-image.json** file, which references foreground and background resources. For details, see [Icon Resource Specifications](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/design-guides/application-icon-0000001953444009#section634668113212).

Example of the **layered-image.json** file:

```json
{
  "layered-image":
    {
      "background":"$media:background," // Background resource
      "foreground":"$media:foreground" // Foreground resource
    }    
}
```

Example of the **icon** structure:

```json
{
  "app":{
    "icon":"$media:layered-image"
  }
}
```

## appEnvironments

The **appEnvironments** tag represents the application environment variables. Applications may depend on some third-party libraries, which may use some custom environment variables. To avoid changing the implementation logic of the third-party libraries, you can set custom environment variables in the project configuration file for use during application running.

**Table 2** appEnvironments

| Name| Description| Data Type| Initial Value Allowed|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| name          | Name of the environment variable. The value is a string with a maximum of 4096 bytes.| String | Yes (initial value: left empty)|
| value         | Value of the environment variable. The value is a string with a maximum of 4096 bytes.      | String | Yes (initial value: left empty)|

Example of the **appEnvironments** structure:

```json
{
  "app": {
    "appEnvironments": [
      {
        "name":"name1",
        "value": "value1"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## multiAppMode

The **multiAppMode** tag represents the multi-app mode of the application.

**Table 3** multiAppMode

| Name| Description| Data Type| Initial Value Allowed|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| multiAppModeType          | Multi-open mode. The options are as follows:<br>- **multiInstance**: multi-instance mode. Only 2-in-1 devices are supported. A resident process does not support this value.<br>- **appClone**: app clone mode.| String | No|
| maxCount         | Maximum number of applications that can be opened. The options are as follows:<br>- In **multiInstance** mode, the value ranges from 1 to 10.<br>- In **appClone** mode, the value ranges from 1 to 5.     | Number | No|

Example of the **multiAppMode** structure:

```json
{
  "app": {
    "multiAppMode": {
      "multiAppModeType": "appClone",
      "maxCount": 5
    }
  }
}
```

## configuration

This tag is a **profile** file resource that used to specify the configuration file that describes the application font size changes with the system.

Example of the **configuration** structure:

```json
{
  "app": {
    "configuration": "$profile:configuration"  
  }
}
```

Define the **configuration.json** file under **AppScope/resources/base/profile** in the development view. The file name (**configuration** in this example) can be customized, but must be consistent with the information specified by the **configuration** tag. The file lists the attributes that enable the application font size to change with the system.

   **Table 4** configuration

| Name| Description| Data Type| Initial Value Allowed|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| fontSizeScale | Settings of the application font size. The options are as follows:<br>- **followSystem**: The font size follows the system.<br>- **nonFollowSystem**: The font size does not follow the system.| String| Yes (initial value: **nonFollowSystem**)|
| fontSizeMaxScale | Maximum ratio of the application font size after the font size is set to follow the system. The options are as follows: 1, 1.15, 1.3, 1.45, 1.75, 2, and 3.2.	 <br> If **fontSizeScale** is set to **nonFollowSystem**, this attribute does not take effect.| String| Yes (initial value: **3.2**)|

Example of the **configuration** structure:

```json
{
  "configuration": {
    "fontSizeScale": "followSystem",
    "fontSizeMaxScale": "3.2"
  }
}
```
