# Ark Bytecode Fundamentals

## Overall Design
### Overview
Ark Bytecode is a binary file generated by the ArkCompiler in ArkTS, TS or JS and provided for Ark to interpret and execute. Bytecode mainly contains Ark Bytecode instructions.<br>
This topic describes the design of Ark Bytecode instructions. The following sections describe the important concepts, formats, and meanings of Ark Bytecode instructions, helping you understand these instructions and develop instruction-related features.<br>
An Ark Bytecode instruction consists of an operation code (instruction name) and an instruction input parameter list. An operation code can be a code without a prefix or with a prefix. Registers, immediates, string id, method id, and literal id can be used as input parameters of instructions. In addition, accumulators are used as default parameters in some instructions.<br>
In Ark Bytecode, in addition to register and accumulator, there are four value storage modes: **global variable**, **[module](https://262.ecma-international.org/12.0/#sec-ecmascript-language-scripts-and-modules) namespace and variable**, **lexical environment and variable**, and **patch variable**. The instruction can use the values stored by these four modes as input parameters.

### Bytecode Composition
#### Operation Code and Prefix
The operation code in the Ark Bytecode is usually encoded as an 8-bit value, so there can be a maximum of 256 operation codes. With the runtime features of the ArkCompiler are getting evolved, the number of bytecode is increasing and has exceeded 256. Therefore, the Ark Bytecode introduces a prefix to extend the maximum width of the operation code from 8 bits to 16 bits. An 8-bit operation code (without a prefix) is used to indicate an instruction that appears frequently, and a 16-bit operation code (with a prefix) is used to indicate an instruction that appears occasionally <br>
An operation code with a prefix is a 16-bit value stored in little-endian mode. It consists of an 8-bit operation code and an 8-bit prefix. You can shift the operation code leftwards by 8 bits and run the **OR** logic with the code and the prefix to encode.
|     Prefix Operation Code     |      Mnemonic       |      Description       |
|     ----------  |    ----------   |    ----------   |
|  0xfe	  |  throw	|  Conditional/Unconditional **throw** instruction. |
|  0xfd	  |  wide	|  An instruction that contains an immediate, id, or register index with a wider encoding width. |
|  0xfc	  |  deprecated	 |  Instructions that are no longer generated by the ArkCompiler are used only to maintain runtime compatibility.<br>Following sections will no longer describe such instructions. |
|  0xfb	  |  callruntime | 	Instructions for calling runtime methods. |

The mnemonic of a prefix operation code is in the form of **prefix mnemonic.operation code mnemonic**, for example, **wide.stlexvar**. If the operation code of the **stlexvar** instruction is **0x0d** and the prefix **wide** is **0xfd**, the operation code of **wide.stlexvar** is **0x0dfd**.

#### Register and Accumulator
The Ark VM model is built based on registers. All registers are virtual registers. When the value of the original type is stored in the register, the width of the register is 64 bits. When the value of the object type is stored in the register, the width of the register is adapted to be wide enough to store the reference to the object.<br>
In Ark Bytecode, there is an invisible register called accumulator (also referred to as acc for short). acc is the default destination register of many instructions and the default parameter of many instructions. It does not occupy the encoding width, which helps generate more compact bytecode.<br>

Example:
```ts
function foo(): number {
    return 1;
}
```
Related instructions in the bytecode:
```assembly
.function any .foo(any a0, any a1, any a2) {
    ldai 0x1
    return
}
```
*ldai 0x1*: loads integer literal **1** to acc.<br>
*return*: returns the value in acc.

#### Immediate
Some instructions in Ark Bytecode use constants to represent data such as integer values, double-precision floating-point values, and jump offsets. Such constants are called immediate, which can be 8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits, or 64 bits.

#### Method Index, String Index, and Literal Index
The Ark Bytecode stores the offsets of all methods, strings, and literal arrays used in the source file. The literal array stores various literal data, such as an integer number, a string offset, and a method offset. In the Ark Bytecode instruction, indexes of these methods, strings, and literal arrays are 16 bits, which are respectively referred to as a method index (method id), a string index (string id), and a literal index (literal id). These indexes are encoded in instructions to reference methods, strings, and literal arrays.

### Value Storage Mode
#### Global Variables
In [Script](https://262.ecma-international.org/12.0/#sec-ecmascript-language-scripts-and-modules) build mode, a global variable is a variable stored in a globally unique mapping. Its key is the name of the global variable, and its value is that of the global variable. Global variables can be accessed through global-related instructions.<br>

Example:
```ts
function foo(): void {
    a += 2;
    b = 5;
}
```
Related instructions in the bytecode:
```assembly
.function any .foo(any a0, any a1, any a2) {
    tryldglobalbyname 0x0, a
    sta v4
    ldai 0x2
    add2 0x1, v4
    trystglobalbyname 0x2, a
    ldai 0x5
    trystglobalbyname 0x3, b
    ...
}
```
*tryldglobalbyname 0x0, a*: loads the global variable named **a** to acc. If this variable does not exist, an exception is thrown.<br>
*trystglobalbyname 0x2, a*: stores the value of acc to the global variable named **a**. If this variable does not exist, an exception is thrown.<br>
*trystglobalbyname 0x3, b*: stores the value of acc to the global variable named **b**. If this variable does not exist, an exception is thrown.<br>
**NOTE**<br>
**0x0**, **0x2**, and **0x3** in the preceding instructions are reserved for internal use in Ark runtime.

#### Module Namespace and Module Variable
All [module namespaces](https://262.ecma-international.org/12.0/#module-namespace-exotic-object) used in the source file are compiled into an array. An index is used in the instruction to reference a module namespace. For example, *getmodulenamespace 0x1* references the module namespace at the *0x1* index.<br>
All module variables used in the source file are compiled into an array. In the instruction, an index is used to reference a module variable. For example, *stmodulevar 0x1* references a module variable at *0x1* index.<br>
In a function, if the declaration of a module variable is in the same source file as the function, the variable is called a local module variable. Otherwise, it is called an external module variable. For example, *ldlocalmodulevar* and *ldexternalmodulevar* are used respectively to load local module variables and external module variables.<br>
The scenarios for generating module instructions include [import](https://262.ecma-international.org/12.0/#sec-imports) and [export](https://262.ecma-international.org/12.0/#sec-exports). The main scenarios are as follows:
* **import * as**: module namespace
* **import { }**: module variable
* **export**: local export

**NOTE**<br>
The logic related to the module is implemented within the compiler. With the evolution of the ArkCompiler, new scenarios involving module instructions may occur. On the other hand, existing scenarios related to module namespaces and module variable instructions may no longer generate module-related instructions as requirements evolve and code is reconstructed.<br>

Example:
```ts
import { a, b } from "./module_foo"
import * as c from "./module_bar"

export let d: number = 3;

a + b + d;
```
Related instructions in the bytecode:
```assembly
.function any .func_main_0(any a0, any a1, any a2) {
    getmodulenamespace 0x1
    ldai 0x3
    stmodulevar 0x0
    ldexternalmodulevar 0x0
    sta v0
    throw.undefinedifholewithname a
    ldexternalmodulevar 0x1
    sta v1
    throw.undefinedifholewithname b
    lda v1
    add2 0x0, v0
    sta v0
    ldlocalmodulevar 0x0
    sta v1
    throw.undefinedifholewithname d
    lda v1
    add2 0x1, v0
    ...
}
```
*getmodulenamespace 0x1*: obtains the module namespace (c) of slot 1 and store it in acc.<br>
*stmodulevar 0x0*: stores the values in acc to slot 0 of the current module.<br>
*ldexternalmodulevar 0x0*: loads the value (a) of slot 0 of the external module and stores it in acc.<br>
*ldlocalmodulevar 0x0*: loads the value (d) of slot 0 of the current local module and stores it in acc.

#### Lexical Environment and Lexical Variable
In Ark Bytecode, a lexical environment may be considered as an array with multiple slots, and each slot corresponds to one lexical variable. Multiple lexical environments may exist in one method. The relative level number and slot index of the lexical environment are used in the instruction to represent a lexical variable. For example, *ldlexvar 0x1, 0x2* is used to store the value of slot 2 in the lexical environment beyond one level to acc.
```
|xxx|xxx|xxx|xxx|   <-- First lexical environment beyond the current lexical environment.
         ^
         |------------ ldlexvar 0x1, 0x2

|xxx|xxx|xxx|xxx|   <-- Current lexical environment.
```
**NOTE**<br>
The logic related to **lexical** is used in the compiler. With subsequent evolution of the ArkCompiler, new scenarios involving lexical instructions may emerge. On the other hand, existing **lexical** instruction-related scenarios may no longer generates **lexical** instructions as requirements evolve and code is reconstructed.
Example:
```ts
function foo(): void {
    let a: number = 1;
    function bar(): number {
        return a;
    }
}
```
Related instructions in the bytecode:
```assembly
.function any .foo(any a0, any a1, any a2) {
    newlexenv 0x1
    ...
    definefunc 0x0, .bar, 0x0
    sta v3
    ldai 0x1 
    ...
    stlexvar 0x0, 0x0
    ...
}    

.function any .bar(any a0, any a1, any a2) {
    ...
    ldlexvar 0x0, 0x0
    ...
}
```
*newlexenv 0x1*: creates a lexical environment whose slot number is 1, stores it in acc, and enters this environment.<br>
*stlexvar 0x0, 0x0*: stores the value in acc to slot 0 of the lexical environment beyond 0 level.<br>
*ldlexvar 0x0, 0x0*: stores the value of slot 0 in the lexical environment beyond 0 level to acc.

#### Patch Variable
The ArkCompiler supports patch mode. When a source file is modified, you can compile it in the patch mode and generate a patch bytecode. The patch bytecode works with the original bytecode to update features. When the ArkCompiler compiles in patch mode, the generated patch variables are stored in a special patch lexical environment. The Ark Bytecode uses the slot number in the patch lexical environment to reference the patch variable. For example, *ldpatchvar 0x1* is used to load the patch variable of slot 1.<br>

Example:
```ts
function bar(): void {} // Add a statement to compile the patch.

function foo(): void {
    bar(); // Add a statement to compile the patch.
}
```
Related instructions in the bytecode:
```assembly
.function any foo(...) {
    ...
    wide.ldpatchvar 0x0
    sta v4
    lda v4
    callarg0 0x0
    ...
}

.function any patch_main_0(...) {
    newlexenv 0x1
    definefunc 0x1, bar:(any,any,any), 0x0
    wide.stpatchvar 0x0
    ...
}
```
*wide.stpatchvar 0x0*: stores the **bar** function to slot 0 in the patch lexical environment.<br>
*wide.ldpatchvar 0x0*: stores the value of slot 0 in the patch lexical environment to acc.

### Function Calling Specifications
For a method that contains N pieces of formal parameters, the last N+3 registers used by the method are used to pass parameters. In this case, the first three registers represent the function (FunctionObject) itself, [new.target](https://262.ecma-international.org/12.0/#sec-function-environment-records) (NewTarget), and **this** in the lexical environment. The subsequent N registers correspond to these N pieces of formal parameters.<br>

Example:
```ts
function foo(a: number, b: number): void {}
```
Related instructions in the bytecode:
```assembly
.function any .foo(any a0, any a1, any a2, any a3, any a4) {
    // a0: FunctionObject
    // a1: NewTarget
    // a2: this 
    // a3: a
    // a4: b
}
```
