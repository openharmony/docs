# Application Package Structure in FA Model


The following figure shows the package structure of an application developed based on the [FA Model](application-configuration-file-overview-fa.md). You should have a basic understanding of the related concepts.


The difference between the application package structures in the FA model and stage model lies in the location where the internal files of a HAP file are stored. In the FA model, all the resource files, library files, and code files are stored in the **assets** folder, where the files are further organized.


- **config.json** is an application configuration file, where the template code is automatically created by DevEco Studio. You can modify the configuration as required. For details about the fields in this file, see [Internal Structure of the app Tag](app-structure.md).

- The **assets** folder is a collection of all the resource files, library files, and code files in a HAP file. It can be further organized into the **entry** folder and the **js** folder. The **entry** folder stores the **resources** folder and the **resources.index** file.

- The **resources** folder stores resource files (such as strings and images) of the application. For details, see [Resource Categories and Access](resource-categories-and-access.md).

- The **resources.index** file provides a resource index table, which is generated by DevEco Studio using the specific SDK tool.

- The **js** folder stores code files created after compilation.

- The **pack.info** file describes the HAP attributes in the bundle, for example, **bundleName** and **versionCode** in **app** and **name**, **type**, and **abilities** in **module**. The file is automatically generated when DevEco Studio builds the bundle.
