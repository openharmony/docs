# Network Kit Terms

## D

### Domain Name System (DNS)

A system that translates human-readable domain names into machine-recognizable IP addresses, enabling the location and access of network resources.

## H

### Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

An application-layer protocol designed for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems.

### HTTPS

A security-enhanced communication protocol built upon HTTP, leveraging SSL/TLS encryption to ensure data transmission confidentiality, integrity, and identity authentication.

## M

### Multicast DNS (MDNS)

A protocol used to automatically discover and configure devices in a local area network (LAN).

## S

### Secure Socket Layer (SSL)

A network security protocol that provides encryption and identity authentication for communications between clients (for example, browsers) and servers, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and reliability of transmitted data.

## T

### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

A connection-oriented, reliable byte-stream transport layer protocol that supports reliable data delivery over IP networks.

### Transport Layer Security (TLS)

A protocol that operates at the transport layer, sitting above TCP and below application protocols like HTTP. As the successor to SSL, which was deprecated due to security flaws, TLS ensures secure communication by encrypting application-layer data (such as HTTP requests) and wrapping it into TCP segments for reliable delivery.

## U

### User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

A connectionless, lightweight transport layer protocol designed for real-time data transmission where reliability is secondary to low latency.

## V

### Virtual Private Network (VPN)

A type of dedicated network that is established on public networks to enable encrypted communication.‌
