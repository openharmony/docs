# Crypto Framework Overview
The Cryptographic (Crypto for shot) Framework shields the implementation differences of third-party cryptographic algorithm libraries and implements encryption and decryption, digital signature and signature verification, and generation of the message authentication code (MAC), hashes, and secure random numbers. You can use the APIs provided by this framework to implement cipher development quickly.

> **NOTE**<br>
> The Crypto Framework provides cryptographic operations, but not key management. It can be used when temporary session keys are used only in the memory or the applications implement secure key storage. If the system is required to provide key management (such as key storage), use the [HUKS](huks-overview.md).

## Working Principles

The Crypto Framework provides components in the following layers:

- Interface layer: provides unified JavaScript interfaces externally.
- Plug-in layer: implements third-party algorithm libraries.
- Framework layer: flexibly loads plug-ins at the plug-in layer to adapt to third-party algorithm libraries and shield differences between these libraries.
## Basic Concepts

### Symmetric Key

A symmetric key is a key used both to encrypt and decrypt data. In symmetric encryption, the sender converts information in plaintext into ciphertext using a key and certain algorithm for security purposes. The receiver converts the ciphertext into plaintext using the same key and algorithm.

- **AES key**

  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the most common symmetric encryption algorithm. AES is a block cipher, which divides plaintext into fixed-length groups of bits, called blocks. A block is encrypted each time until the entire plaintext is encrypted. The block size in AES is 128 bits. That is, each block contains 16 bytes (8 bits/byte). The AES key length can be 128 bits, 192 bits, or 256 bits.

- **3DES key**

  Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES), also called 3DESede or Triple DES, applies the DES cipher three times to each data block. It uses three 64-bit keys to encrypt a data block three times. Compared with DES, 3DES provides higher security due to longer key length, but lower processing speed. AES is faster and more secure than 3DES.

- **SM4 key**

  ShangMi 4 (SM4) is a block cipher that has a key size and a block size of 128 bits each. Both the encryption and decryption of one block of data is composed of 32 rounds. A non-linear key scheduler is used to produce the round keys. The decryption uses the same round keys as for encryption, except that they are in reversed order.

- **HMAC key**

  Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) is a key-based message authentication code algorithm. HMAC provides authentication using a shared secret instead of using a digital signature. The MAC generated can be used to verify the integrity and authenticity of the message. The length of the MAC generated by HMAC is fixed.

  An HMAC key can be of any length. If the length of the key is greater than the length of the digest algorithm information block, the one-way hash result of the key is used as the new key. If the length of the key is less than the length of the digest algorithm information block, 0s are padded at the end of the key as the new key. That is, the key length is the same as the length of the digest algorithm information block.

### Asymmetric Key

In the asymmetric cryptography, a private and public key pair is required. The private key is used to encrypt the plaintext, and the public key is used to decrypt the ciphertext. The public key is public and open to anyone in the system, while the private key is private. For digital signature and signature verification, the private key is used to sign the plaintext, and the public key is used to verify the signature data.

- **RSA key**

  Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) is an asymmetric encryption algorithm widely used for secure data transmission. The security of RSA depends on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers.

  The RSA key parameters include the following integers:

  **n**: modulus, which is a public parameter of the private key and public key.

  **sk**: private exponent, which is often written as **d** in the formula.

  **pk**: public exponent, which is often written as **e** in the formula.

- **ECC key**

  Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) is a public-key encryption algorithm based on elliptic curve mathematics. It security is based on the assumption that it is infeasible to find the discrete logarithm of a random elliptic curve element with respect to a publicly known base point. The Crypto Framework provides capabilities for generating a variety of ECC keys.

  The ECC algorithm can be regarded as an operation of numbers defined in a special set. Currently, the Crypto Framework supports elliptic curves in **Fp** fields, where **p** is prime. The **Fp** fields are also called the prime fields.

  The ECC key parameters in the **Fp** fields include the following:

  **p**: prime number used to determine **Fp**.

  **a**, **b**: determine the elliptic curve equation.

  **g**: base point of the elliptic curve, which can be represented as **gx** or **gy**.

  **n**: order of the base point **g**.

  **h**: cofactor.

  **sk**: private key, which is a random integer less than **n**.

  **pk**: public key, which is a point on the elliptic curve. **pk** = **sk** x **g**.

- **DSA key**

  Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is a public-key algorithm based on the modular exponentiation and discrete logarithm problem. It is used for digital signatures and signature verification, but not for encryption and decryption. The Crypto Framework provides the capability of generating DSA keys of different lengths.

  The DSA key parameters include the following:

  **p**: a prime modulus, whose length is an integer multiple of 64.

  **q**: prime factor of p – 1. The length varies depending on the length of **p**.

  **g**: g = (h ^ ((p - 1) / q)) mod p, where **h** is any integer that meets 1 < h < p -1.

  **sk**: private key, which is a randomly generated integer and complies with 0 < sk < q.

  **pk**: public key. pk = (g ^ sk) mod p

- **SM2 key**

  ShangMi 2 (SM2) is a public key cryptographic algorithm based on the ECC. The key length is 256 bits. The SM2 algorithm uses the elliptic curve in the Fp fields.

  The SM2 key parameters in the **Fp** fields include the following:

  **p**: a prime greater than 3, used to determine **Fp**.

  **a**, **b**: determine the elliptic curve equation.

  **g**: base point of the elliptic curve, which can be represented as **gx** or **gy**.

  **n**: order of the base point **g**.

  **h**: cofactor.

  **sk**: private key, which is a random integer less than **n**.

  **pk**: public key, which is a point on the elliptic curve. **pk** = **sk** x **g**.

### Encryption and Decryption

- **Symmetric AES encryption and decryption**

  The algorithm library provides the following cipher modes of operation for AES: ECB, CBC, OFB, CFB, CTR, GCM, and CCM. AES is a block cipher, with a fixed block size of 128 bits. In actual applications, the last block of plaintext may be less than 128 bits and needs to be padded. The padding options are as follows:
  - **NoPadding**: no padding.

  - **PKCS5**: pads a block cipher with a block size of 8 bytes.

  - **PKCS7**: pads any block size from 1 to 255 bytes. The PKCS #7 padding scheme is the same as that of PKCS #5.


  > **NOTE**
  >
  > - In ECB and CBC modes, the plaintext must be padded if its length is not an integer multiple of 128 bits.
  > - Since the plaintext is padded to the block size, the PKCS #5 and PKCS #7 used in the algorithm library use the block size as the padding length. That is, data is padded to 16 bytes in AES encryption.

- **Symmetric 3DES encryption and decryption**

  3DES encryption and decryption apply the DES cipher three times to each data block to obtain the ciphertext or plaintext.

  The algorithm library provides the following cipher modes of operation for 3DES encryption and decryption: ECB, CBC, OFB, and CFB. DES is a block cipher, with a fixed block size of 64 bits. In actual applications, the last block of plaintext may be less than 64 bits and needs to be padded. The padding options are as follows:
  - **NoPadding**: no padding.
  - **PKCS5**: pads a block cipher with a block size of 8 bytes.
  - **PKCS7**: pads any block size from 1 to 255 bytes. The PKCS #7 padding scheme is the same as that of PKCS #5.

  > **NOTE**
  >
  > - In ECB and CBC modes, the plaintext must be padded if its length is not an integer multiple of 64 bits.
  > - Since the plaintext is padded to the block size, the PKCS #5 and PKCS #7 used in the algorithm library use the block size as the padding length. That is, data is padded to 8 bytes in 3DES encryption.

- **Symmetric SM4 encryption and decryption**

  The Crypto Framework provides the following SM4 encryption modes: ECB, CBC, CTR, OFB, CFB, and CFB128. SM4 is a block cipher, with a fixed block size of 128 bits. In actual applications, the last block of plaintext may be less than 128 bits and needs to be padded. The padding options are as follows:

  - **NoPadding**: no padding.
  - **PKCS5**: pads a block cipher with a block size of 8 bytes.
  - **PKCS7**: pads any block size from 1 to 255 bytes. The PKCS #7 padding scheme is the same as that of PKCS #5.

  > **NOTE**
  >
  > - In ECB and CBC modes, the plaintext must be padded if its length is not an integer multiple of 128 bits.
  > - Since the plaintext is padded to the block size, the PKCS #5 and PKCS #7 used in the algorithm library use the block size as the padding length. That is, data is padded to 16 bytes in SM4 encryption.

- **Asymmetric RSA encryption and decryption**

  RSA is an asymmetric cipher, with fixed-length blocks. In actual applications, diverse padding modes are used. Currently, the Crypto Framework provides the following padding modes:
  - **NoPadding**: no padding. The length of the input or output data must be the same as that of the RSA key modulus.

  - **PKCS1**: RSAES-PKCS1-V1_5 mode in RFC3447 (corresponding to RSA_PKCS1_PADDING in OpenSSL). The RSA converts the source data D into an encryption block (EB). In encryption, the length of the input data must be less than or equal to the RSA key modulus minus 11. The length of the output data is the same as that of the RSA key modulus.

  - **PKCS1_OAEP**: RSAES-OAEP mode in RFC 3447 (corresponding to RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING in OpenSSL). It is a new padding mode developed by PKCS#1. In this mode, two digests (**md** and **mgf1_md**) need to be set. During encryption, the length of the input data must meet the following requirements:

    Input data length < RSA key modulus – **md** length (bytes) – **mgf1_md** length (bytes) – 2

    The length of the output data is the same as that of the RSA key modulus. In this mode, you can also set the **pSource** byte stream to define the encoding input **P** filled by OAEP and obtain the parameters related to PKCS1_OAEP.

    The **PKCS1_OAEP** parameters include the following:

    - **md**: message digest algorithm.
    - **mgf**: mask generation algorithm. Currently, only MGF1 is supported.
    - **mgf1_md**: mgf1 digest algorithm.
    - **pSource**: byte stream, which is the source for encoding input P in OAEP padding.

  > **NOTE**<br>
  > RSA key modulus = (RSA bits + 7)/8

- **Asymmetric SM2 encryption and decryption**

  SM2 is an asymmetric encryption algorithm based on the ECC. The encryption length is fixed. Currently, the Crypto Framework supports encrypted data in C1C3C2 format and decryption of data in C1C3C2 format.

### Signing and Signature Verification

- **RSA signing and signature verification**

  The Crypto Framework provides the following padding modes for RSA signing and signature verification:
  - **PKCS1**: RSASSA-PKCS1-V1_5 mode in RFC3447 (corresponding to RSA_PKCS1_PADDING in OpenSSL). When this mode is used for signing and signature verification, the digest (**md**) must be set, the digest algorithm output length (bytes) must be less than the RSA key modulus.

  - **PSS**: RSASSA-PSS mode in RFC 3447 (corresponding to RSA_PKCS1_PSS_PADDING in OpenSSL). In this mode, two digests (**md** and **mgf1_md**) must be set, and the total length (bytes) of **md** and **mgf1_md** must be less than the RSA key modulus. In this mode, the salt length (**saltLen**, in bytes) can also be set, and PSS-related parameters can be obtained.

    The PSS parameters include the following:

    - **md**: message digest algorithm.
    - **mgf**: mask generation algorithm. Currently, only MGF1 is supported.
    - **mgf1_md**: digest algorithm used in the MGF1 algorithm.
    - **saltLen**: salt length, in bytes.
    - **trailer_field**: integer used for encoding. The value must be **1**.

  > **NOTE**<br>
  > RSA key modulus = (RSA bits + 7)/8

- **ECDSA**

  The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is a digital signature algorithm that uses the ECC. Compared with the ordinary Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) and Integer Factorization Problem (IFP), the ECC provides a higher unit bit strength than other public-key cryptographic systems. The Crypto Framework provides the ECDSA that combines multiple elliptic curves and digest algorithms.

- **DSA**

  The DSA security is based on the difficulty of the DLP in integer finite field. The DSA features high compatibility and applicability.

- **SM2**

  SM2 is a digital signature algorithm based on the ECC.


### Key Agreement

**ECDH**

Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel. The Crypto Framework provides a variety of ECDH capabilities based on the open-source algorithm library.

### Message Digest

The message digest algorithm allows a fixed-length digest to be generated from data of arbitrary size by using the hash algorithm. It is used for sensitive information encryption because it is infeasible to invert or reverse the computation. The MD algorithm is also referred to as a hash algorithm or a one-way hash algorithm.

When the same digest algorithm is used, the generated digest (hash value) has the following features:

- The same message always results in the same hash value.
- The digest generated is of the fixed length no matter the length of messages. (The digest length is determined by the algorithm used).
- It is almost impossible to find two different messages with the same hash value. (The probability still exists, depending on the length of the digest.)

### HMAC

Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) is a key-based message authentication code algorithm. It implements authentication using a shared secret rather than a digital signature. The MAC generated can be used to verify the integrity and authenticity of the message. The length of the MAC generated by HMAC is fixed. Compared with MAC, HMAC introduces the shared secret, which ensures data correctness.

### Random Number

Random numbers are mainly used to generate temporary session keys or keys in asymmetric encryption. They are generated by a hardware random number generator or software-based pseudo-random number generator. In encryption and decryption, a secure random number generator must feature randomness, unrepeatability, and unpredictability. The random numbers generated by the Cryptography Secure Random Number Generator (CSPRNG) meet the requirements of cryptography security pseudo-randomness.

- Internal state<br>A value in the random number generator memory. The same internal state produces the same sequence of the random number.
- Seed<br>A number used to initialize the internal state of a pseudorandom number generator. The random number generator generates a series of random sequences based on the seeds.

## Constraints

- The Crypto Framework does not support concurrent operations of multiple threads.
- Currently, the algorithm library supports only OpenSSL.
- For a key generated based on key parameters, the bigint type must be a positive number in big-endian format.
- The Crypto Framework algorithm library provides common algorithms. Some algorithms and specifications, such as MD5, are not applicable to security scenarios. You need to select the proper algorithms as required.

### **Asymmetric SM2 Encryption and Decryption**

> **NOTE**
>
> The APIs support specifications without the key length for asymmetric SM2 encryption and decryption from API version 10.

The SM2 encryption and decryption support only the ciphertext in C1C3C2 format. The SM2 asymmetric encryption result consists of C1, C2, and C3. C1 is the elliptic curve points calculated based on the random number generated. C2 is the ciphertext data. C3 is the value calculated using the specified digest algorithm. The new SM standard support data in C1C3C2 format. Encryption without digest is not supported.

The following parameters are supported.

| Asymmetric Key Type| Digest| String Parameter|
|---|---|---|
|SM2_256|[MD5\|SHA1\|SHA224\|SHA256\|SHA384\|SHA512\|SM3]|SM2_256\|[MD5\|SHA1\|SHA224\|SHA256\|SHA384\|SHA512\|SM3]|
