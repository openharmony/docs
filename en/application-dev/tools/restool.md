# restool


## Overview

restool is a resource compilation tool that creates resource indexes and parses resources by compiling resource files. You can call the [resource management APIs](../reference/apis-localization-kit/js-apis-resource-manager.md) to obtain resources. The tool is stored in the **toolchains** subdirectory of the SDK installation directory.

## Description

The tool supports the following command options.

| Option| Default Value Allowed| Argument Carried| Description|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| -i | No| Yes| [Resource directory](#compiling-resources) or [resource intermediate file directory](#compiling-resources) to create. The same command can run multiple times.|
| -j | No| Yes| Path of the **config.json** or **module.json** file.|
| -o | No| Yes| Output path of the compiled resource.|
| -p | No| Yes| Bundle name of the compiled resource.|
| -r | No| Yes| Header file path of the resource. The header file can be in .txt, .js, or .h format.|
| -e | Yes| Yes| Start ID of the generated resource, for example, **0x01000000**. The value range is [0x01000000, 0x06FFFFFF) and [0x08000000, 0x41FFFFFF).|
| -f | Yes| No| An existing output path will be forcibly deleted and a new one will be generated.|
| -h | Yes| No| Help information.|
| -m | Yes| Yes| Module name. During joint module compilation, multiple module names can be specified, separated by commas (,).|
| -x | Yes| Yes| Resource directory for generating intermediate files or a single resource path. The same command can run multiple times.|
| -z | Yes| No| Compilation result generated based on the resource intermediate file directory.|
| -v | Yes| No| Tool version.|
| --ids | Yes| Yes| Output directory of the generated **id_defined.json** file.|
| --defined-ids | Yes| Yes| Path of the **id_defined.json** file. Generally, the file is generated by using **--ids**.<br>**id_defined.json** contains a list of resource types, names, and IDs.<br>You can customize resource IDs in **id_defined.json**.|
| --icon-check | Yes| No| Whether to enable PNG image verification for icons and startWindowIcons.|
| --target-config | Yes| Yes| Used together with the **-i** command to support compilation selection.<br>[Parameter description](#target-config-parameters): Specify the configurations to be included.|

### target-config Parameters

Supported parameters: **MccMnc**, **Locale**, **Orientation**, **Device**, **ColorMode**, and **Density**

Format: Use semicolons (;) to separate different parameter configurations. Use square brackets ([]) to encapsulate values for a parameter and use commas (,) to separate values.

**MccMnc** matching rule: The MCC must always be used for matching. If an MNC is not included, a match is found as long as the MCC is the same. If an MNC is included, a match is found when both the MCC and MNC are the same.

**Locale** matching rules:

1. The language must always be used for matching.

2. If a script (text) is not included, a match is found as long as the language is the same. If a script is included, a match is found when both the language and script are the same.

3. If a country/region is not included, a match is found as long as the language is the same. If a country/region is included, a match is found when both the language and country/region are the same.

Example: Locale[zh_CN,en_US];Device[phone]. This configuration uses the languages zh_CN and en_US and the device phone as filter criteria. A match is found only when the resources use zh_CN and en_US as the languages and apply to phones. Other parameters (such as **MccMnc** and **Orientation**) are not configured and any values of them can match.

## Example

An example **entry** directory structure is as follows:
```
entry/src/main
|    |----resource
|    |    |----base
|    |    |    |----element
|    |    |    |----media
|    |    |    |----profile
|    |    |----rawfile
|    |    |----resfile
|    |----config.json/module.json
```

### Compiling Resources

There are two resource compilation modes: full resource compilation and incremental resource compilation.

1. To compile all resources, run the following command:

```
restool -i entry/src/main -j entry/src/main/module.json -p com.ohos.demo -o out -r out/ResourceTable.txt -f
```

2. To compile incremental resources, perform the following steps:

Step 1: Generate the resource middleware.

```
restool -x entry/src/main/resource -o out
```
Step 2: Compile the resource middleware.

```
restool -i out1 -i out2 -o out -p com.ohos.demo -r out/ResourceTable.txt -j entry/src/main/module.json -f -z
```

### Fixing the Resource ID

To fix the resource ID, perform the following steps:

Step 1: Create the **id_defined.json** file. There are two ways to create the file.

+ Run the following command to generate the file:

```
restool -i entry/src/main -j entry/src/main/module.json -p com.ohos.demo -o out -r out/ResourceTable.txt --ids out -f
```

+ Customize the **id_defined.json** file with the following content:

```
{
    "record" :
    [
        {
            "id": "0x01000000", // A fixed ID for the resource.
            "name": "app_name", // Resource name.
            "type": "string" // Resource type.
        }
    ]
}
```

Step 2: Fix the resource ID. There are two ways to fix the resource ID.

+ Run the following command to fix the resource ID:
```
restool -i entry/src/main -j entry/src/main/module.json -p com.ohos.demo -o out1 -r out1/ResourceTable.txt --defined-ids out/id_defined.json -f
```

+ Place the customized **id_defined.json** file in the **resource/base/element/** directory and then run the following command to fix the resource ID:
```
restool -i entry/src/main -j entry/src/main/module.json -p com.ohos.demo -o out1 -r out1/ResourceTable.txt  -f
```
