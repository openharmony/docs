# Overview of Multilingual Sorting

The sorting rules for characters may vary according to languages and cultures. The sorting function allows your application to apply different sorting rules for users in different countries or regions and using different languages. Besides, it enables your application to output sorting results with semantic features, instead to facilitate query and search. The function is applicable in use cases such as language list, country/region list, and contact list.

Currently, sorting can be implemented by [local habits](i18n-sorting-local.md) or [indexes](i18n-sorting-index.md).
