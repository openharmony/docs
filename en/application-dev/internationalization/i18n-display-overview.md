# Overview
Localization means to display regional elements such as language, region, script, time zone, calendar, and date according to local linguistic habits.

This module provides the following three methods for localization:
1. [Name localization](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DisplayNames): Localize the names of languages, regions, scripts, currencies, calendars, and time fields (such as year, month, and day) by using **Intl.Displaynames**.
2. [Language and region name localization](i18n-language-region-display.md): Localize the names of languages and regions by using **i18n.System.getDisplayLanguage** and **i18n.System.getDisplayCountry**. 
3. [Time zone name localization](i18n-time-zone-display.md): Localize the names of time zones by using **i18n.TimeZone**.
