> ![icon-note.gif](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE**:
> - All examples use the TypeScript (TS) language. If you are using another language, comply with the syntax requirements for that language.
> 
> - The components used in the examples are preset in the UI framework and are used only to explain the UI description specifications.
> 
> - Universal attribute and event methods generally apply to all components, and the attribute and event methods within a component apply only to this component.
