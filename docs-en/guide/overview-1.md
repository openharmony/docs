This document describes how to use the IoT camera development board and the built-in camera and screen of the development kit to implement photographing, video recording, and video preview.

You can perform operations provided in  [Use Case](use-case-5.md)  to learn more about development board peripheral control and then develop devices, such as peephole cameras, smart rear-view mirrors, and smart displays.

If you want to view the sample effect first, see  [Use Case](use-case-5.md). To customize application behavior, modify the sample code by referring to APIs described in  [Development Guidelines](development-guidelines-2.md).

For details about basic concepts for camera development, see the  [camera development overview](../subsystems/overview.md).
