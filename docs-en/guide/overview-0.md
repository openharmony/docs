This document describes how to use the IoT camera development board and the built-in camera of the development kit to implement photographing and video recording.

You can perform operations provided in  [Use Case](use-case.md)  to learn more about development board peripheral control and then develop devices, such as security cameras.

If you want to view the sample effect first, see  [Use Case](use-case.md). To customize application behavior, modify the sample code by referring to APIs described in  [Development Guidelines](development-guidelines.md).

For details about basic concepts for camera development, see the  [camera development overview](../subsystems/overview.md).
